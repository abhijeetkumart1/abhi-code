Assignment 2: Create a Landing Page using HTML
In this assignment, you will design a Landing Page, which is usually the first thing visitors see when they visit a website. It’s used to introduce a product, service, or personal brand and guide users toward taking an action.

Objective:
Build a single-page layout that presents clear information about your product, service, or profile. The main goal is to encourage user interaction, such as:

Signing up for a newsletter
Downloading a file or guide
Exploring more about the offering
Use only HTML. Structure your content well using semantic tags like <header>, <section>, <main>, and <footer>. Focus on clarity and layout.

Great! If you’ve completed both assignments, you now have the confidence to move forward and learn HTML and CSS more effectively.

This course is designed to give you both practical skills and theoretical knowledge, which are equally important — not just for cracking interviews, but also for working on real-world industry projects.
